## MESSAGE:

There is a disagreement over where US Drift should be shown on the DPR.  
After discussions with all of you, it is apparent that Mark Frevert must make 
the decision about whether to move US Drift from the Enron Global Markets 
section where it currently resides to the Enron Americas section.

As I understand it Mark is currently traveling and out of reach.  Once I know 
his decision, any necessary changes will be made.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Best regards

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on 
that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she 
had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that 
Friday and were not able to.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you 
the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into 
my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave 
it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able 
to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask 
Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she 
always knows how to reach me.

Sara: 

I will forward the documents to you.  

For future reference, if anyone is looking for a file for an urgent matter 
while I am out, she should convey that fact to me by either (1) leaving a 
voice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to 
speak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will 
contact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on 
Friday.

Cheryl:

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
message with Sharon Chernick.

In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. 
("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the 
following documents:

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday 
of last week.  

Thanks.
